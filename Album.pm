=head1 NAME

Album - Create and maintain HTML based photo albums

=head1 SYNOPSIS

A photo album consists of a number of (large) pictures, small thumbnail
images, and index pages. Optionally, medium sized images can be
generated as well. Also, it is possible to embed other albums.

The album will be organised as follows:

  index.html       first or only index page
  indexN.html      subsequent index pages (N = 1, 2, ...)
  icons/           directory with navigation icons
  large/           original (large) images, with HTML pages
  medium/          optional medium sized images, with HTML pages
  thumbnail/       thumbnail images

Each image can be labeled with a description, a tag (applies to a
group of images, e.g. a date), the image name, and some
characteristics (size and dimensions).

Images can be handled 'in situ', or imported from e.g. a CD-ROM or
digital camera. Optionally, EXIF information from digital camera files
can be taken into account.

The photo albums are the digital equivalents of paper albums, but
easier to create and maintain. Although you can publish a photo album
on the Web, this tool is not specifically targeted at creating Web
shows.
