* Formats for the HTML pages can be external.

  Files in directory 'formats' will be used if they exists, and
  created if option --extformats is used.
  Files: index.fmt image.fmt large.fmt medium.fmt journal.fmt.

* All formats get hbuttons and vbuttons.

* !depth N, to use icons, css and formats from another, N higher directory.

* !medium N, use -1 to reset medium format.

* If journaling, the right top text of the image pages shows the
  journal text when hovered.

* Bug fixes

  - Correctly write info entries when journaling.

  - Sometimes mplayer doesn't produce a still.

  - Silence many warnings and info from mplayer.

  - Output HTML entities for non-ascii characters. Use Latin-9 instead
    of Latin-1.
