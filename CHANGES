Version 1.07

* Added primary index in top dir, plus associates style sheets and
  format (key: main). Added background image.

* 'album' will no longer write external stylesheets by default. Use
  --extcss to initally create the external style sheets.

* When using external style sheets or formats, 'album' will verify
  that the style sheets match the formats by checking the VERSION
  lines.

* Index pages are now written in subdirectory index/ , and numbered
  index0001.html and so on.

* The thumbnails are moved from thumbnails/ to index/ . The
  thumbnails/ directory is no longer used.

  A quick way to migrate an existing album is to remove all
  index*.html pages, and rename the thumbnails/ directory to index/ .
  (And, probably, remove the css/ directory as well.)

#### WARNING: INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE ####

  Almost all of the formatting has been moved to the style sheets.
  As a consequence, newly generated pages will probably not look as
  they should if you have style sheets from a previous version of
  album.

  Album now verifies that existing style sheets start with a line:

    /* ALBUM-CSS-VERSION: 1.0 */

  If this line is missing (as is the case with older style sheets), or
  the version number is not compatible with this version of album, a
  fatal error is given and the program terminates.

  Should you run into this situation (which is likely to occur once
  for every existing album), then move the style sheets to a backup
  location, run album, and re-apply your changes (if any) to the new
  style sheets.

#### END INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE ####

* 'info.dat' may now designate its encoding system, if needed:

  # -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

#### WARNING: INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE ####

* Medium sized images will not be resized if the original (large)
  image is within the specified limits.

  To obtain the old behaviour of enlarging the image, specify an '!'
  after the medium size:

    mediumsize 915!

#### END INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE ####

* It is now possible to select which images are included. Command line
  option --select. Possible values are:

    default   (all except hidden)
    all       (all)
    hidden    (only the hidden images)
    tag:XXX   (substring search on tag)
    tag:/XXX/ (pattern search on tag).

  Note that selection applies to the image pages only. The journal is
  (currently?) not affected by a selection.

* Fix problem where file names in info were not found in journal mode.

* Fix problem with 'backspace' key on 2nd large/medium pages.

* Mencoder now seems to need '-vf' instead of '-vop'. Bye bye
  compatibility. However, this only affects rotation of movies.

* Tutorial: Document keyboard navigation.

* Tutorial: Document external formats (**EXPERIMENTAL**).

* Tutorial: Document journal (**EXPERIMENTAL**).

* Change HTML for journal pages: now requires style sheet to (v)align
  the cells.

Version 1.06,

* Hide in-line uuencoded material from prying eyes of stupid POD
  converters.

Version 1.05,

* Several file naming fixes for Windows. Thanks to Slaven Rezic and
  Aldo Calpini for being guinea pigs.

* Do not copy movies unless they require rotation. Link them if
  possible.

* Album should now be fully functional on Windows platforms.

Version 1.04, Fri Oct 20 16:48:60 CET 2006

* Install Album and, more important, Album::Tutorial.

* Allow file names with spaces and other uglyness.

* Allow avi and mov file extensions for movies.

* Allow non-DCF filenames in the import area.

Version 1.03,Thu Sep 21 15:46:00 CET 2006

* Keyboard navigation for web pages.

  Space	    -> next
  Backspace -> previous
  Enter	    -> detail
  d	    -> index page (dir)
  u	    -> up
  j	    -> journal

* Formats for the HTML pages can be external.

  Files in directory 'formats' will be used if they exists, and
  created if option --extformats is used.
  Files: index.fmt image.fmt large.fmt medium.fmt journal.fmt.

* All formats get hbuttons and vbuttons.

* !depth N, to use icons, css and formats from another, N higher directory.

* !medium N, use -1 to reset medium format.

* If journaling, the right top text of the image pages shows the
  journal text when hovered.

* Bug fixes

  - Correctly write info entries when journaling.

  - Sometimes mplayer doesn't produce a still.

  - Silence many warnings and info from mplayer.

  - Output HTML entities for non-ascii characters. Use Latin-9 instead
    of Latin-1.
